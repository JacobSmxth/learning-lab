# 🐍 Python Lab

This directory documents my work with Python, focused on scripting, automation, GUI/TUI development, and early object-oriented design. Python serves as a rapid prototyping tool and a foundation for writing secure, maintainable tools with minimal overhead.

## 💡 Projects Summary

### `objectTodoProgram/`
- Modular OOP design using `todo.py`, `guiTodo.py`, and `tui.py`
- Saves persistent state using `data.json`
- Demonstrates early full-stack CLI/GUI project structure

### `terminalPomodoroTimer/`
- Terminal-based Pomodoro timer
- Plays sound effects for start/break/done using `playsound` or `pygame`

---

## 🧠 Learning Themes

- Scripting and CLI workflows
- JSON data persistence
- Terminal-based user interfaces (TUI)
- Modularization and beginner OOP
- Basic time and I/O libraries

---

## 🚀 Roadmap

- [ ] GUI with PySide6 or Tkinter
- [ ] File parsing and automation utilities
- [ ] Network and API interaction
- [ ] Intro to unit testing and linting
- [ ] Cryptographic tooling with `cryptography` and `hashlib`

⚙️ *Python is my rapid tooling environment for scripting, experimentation, and automation — before moving deeper into compiled languages and security tools.*
