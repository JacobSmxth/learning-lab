# 🧪 learning-lab

**Author:** [JacobSmxth](https://github.com/JacobSmxth)
**Focus:** Deep-dive systems programming — from C to Go — backed by experiments, tools, and documentation.

## 📘 Overview

This is my centralized lab space for mastering systems-level engineering.

Every directory is a self-contained training ground — featuring syntax practice, applied tooling, and real-world project scaffolds in C, Go, Assembly, and Rust. The structure is modular, traceable, and optimized for skill-building.

> I’m not just learning how to code. I’m learning how systems work — at the binary, OS, and protocol level.

## 🧠 Structure

learning-lab/
├── C/ # Core memory, process, and socket fundamentals
├── Go/ # Backend systems, concurrency, tooling (in progress)
├── Rust/ # Future: safe systems programming experiments
├── Assembly/ # 16-bit x86 fundamentals (paused)
└── Python/ # Automation & scripting utilities (optional)

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Build confidence writing raw C — memory management, system calls, concurrency
- Transition to Go for backend tooling and service design
- Reinforce systems concepts through repeated low-level exposure
- Consolidate learning into reusable modules, tools, and references
- Prepare for internships, interviews, and real-world infrastructure roles

## 🛠️ Toolchain

| Domain       | Stack                                                                 |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Editor**   | Neovim (Lua) + Lazy.nvim                                              |
| **Shell**    | Zsh with custom scripts                                               |
| **Builds**   | `make`, `gcc`, `clang`, `cargo`, `go mod`, `nasm`, `qemu-system-x86` |
| **Debugging**| `valgrind`, `gdb`, `strace`, `lsof`, `tcpdump`                        |
| **OS**       | Arch Linux + Hyprland                                                 |

## 🚧 Project Labs by Language

### 🔹 `C/`
- `basics/`, `intermediate/`, `KnRBook/`
- Projects: CLI password manager, dynamic task manager, sockets, allocators

### 🔸 `Go/`
- Early tools and backend learning (REST APIs and CLI tools planned)

### 🟤 `Rust/`
- Initialized but paused — will resume post-Go fundamentals

### ⚪ `Assembly/`
- BIOS-level bootloader, register experiments, interrupts

---

## 📜 Documentation & Workflow

Each language folder includes:

- `README.md` or `overview.md`
- Notes, experiments, and challenge solutions
- Clean folder structures and build instructions

I document what works, what breaks, and what I learn.
