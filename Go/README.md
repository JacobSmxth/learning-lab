# 🚀 Go Programming Lab

This directory tracks my journey learning the Go programming language (Golang), with an emphasis on backend development, networking, and modern concurrency patterns. Go will serve as my bridge between low-level systems programming (C) and scalable, production-ready infrastructure tooling.

├── 02_projects/ # Real-world practice projects
│ └── webServer/ # Simple static file server with routing logic
└── README.md

## 🧠 Key Learning Themes

- ✅ Go syntax & type system
- ✅ Slices, maps, and struct manipulation
- ✅ Package management and module workflow
- 🔄 Planned focus on goroutines, channels, and CSP concurrency model
- 🧱 Building scalable, composable backend tools

---

## 📦 Projects

### `webServer/`
A basic HTTP server that:
- Serves static HTML files
- Handles routing
- Sets the stage for deeper exploration of middleware and REST APIs

---

## 🛠 Tooling

- Built using the `go` CLI (`go run`, `go build`, `go mod init`)
- Organized using idiomatic Go project structure
- Tested manually via `curl`, `httpie`, and browser clients

---

## 📈 Roadmap

- [ ] Command-line tooling
- [ ] File parsers and automation scripts
- [ ] RESTful APIs with `net/http`
- [ ] gRPC experimentation
- [ ] Concurrency with goroutines and channels
- [ ] Dockerized Go services
