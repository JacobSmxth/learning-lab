# 1. Main Story

You are a nameless victim, awakening in the dark with no memory. Your only goal is to survive and escape a decaying, labyrinthine laboratory. You soon discover you are not alone. You find a bastion of hope in **Ben**, a fellow captive and a man of unwavering faith, and a whirlwind of despair in **Micah**, a man driven to madness searching for his childhood friend, **Tristan**.

You learn that Tristan is the master of this prison—a brilliant scientist who has sacrificed his humanity in a dark quest for "ascension." You, the player, are just one of his many test subjects. To escape, you must navigate the ruins of the lab, uncover the tragic story of Tristan and Micah, and confront the monster who holds all your lives in his hands.

# 2. The Storyline (Plot Progression)

### Act I: Awakening & Sanctuary
The player awakens in a holding cell. Their initial goal is pure survival: find light, find a way out of the cell, and explore the immediate surroundings. They soon find **Ben's Sanctuary**, a small, safe room where Ben explains their shared predicament: they are captives of a scientist named Tristan, and the player is a recent arrival. Ben offers guidance and a place to rest.

### Act II: The Ghost in the Machine
The player ventures further, seeking an escape route. In the derelict library, they encounter **Micah**, who is frantic and paranoid, muttering about finding the "real" Tristan. He is not hostile, but he is lost in his own world. The player begins finding items—a photograph of a smiling Tristan and Micah, Tristan's chilling research notes—that reveal the story of two friends torn apart by obsession. The player's quest for escape becomes entangled with the tragedy of these two men.

### Act III: Confrontation at the Cradle
Guided by Ben's wisdom and the clues they've gathered, the player understands the only way out is through the heart of the lab: the **Observation Deck** overlooking the **Main Laboratory**. There, they find Tristan monitoring his "Ascension Cradle." Micah is also present, perhaps trapped or having just been captured. The final confrontation begins, where the player must use their knowledge and wits to turn the situation to their advantage.

# 3. Room List

* **The Holding Cells (Dungeon):** The starting area. A block of dark, cold cells.
* **Maintenance Tunnels:** A maze-like network of corridors connecting different parts of the lab. Dark, claustrophobic, and potentially home to failed experiments.
* **The Library:** A wrecked room with overturned shelves. Now the frantic base of operations for Micah.
* **West Wing - Living Quarters:**
    * **Guest Room:** Shows signs of forced entry. This is where Micah broke in and has been staying. Contains *Micah's Plea* (a letter he wrote to Tristan).
    * **Tristan's Room:** Cold, obsessively organized. The walls are covered in complex, terrifying diagrams of the human nervous system. Contains the *Smashed Photograph* of him and Micah.
* **Ben's Sanctuary:** A converted storage closet where Ben has his makeshift chapel. The only safe room.
* **The Main Laboratory:** The heart of Tristan's experiments. In the center is the "Ascension Cradle," a horrifying machine of wires and polished steel.
* **The Observation Deck:** A sterile, glass-walled room overlooking the main lab. This is Tristan's throne room and the location of the final encounter.

### Quest & Utility Items

* **Level 1 Keycard:** Found on a fallen guard; opens basic areas.

### Lore & Story Items
* **The Smashed Photograph:** A picture of a young, happy Tristan and Micah, found in Tristan's room. When the player shows this to Micah, it might temporarily calm him.

* **Micah's Plea:** A crumpled letter found in the Guest Room, written by Micah, begging his friend to stop and come home. Highlights the tragedy of their story.
* **Audio Log #1 (Tristan):** *"The hypothesis is sound. Consciousness is merely data. It can be copied, edited, perfected..."*
* **Audio Log #2 (Tristan):** *"Micah doesn't understand. He sees friendship as a bond. I see it as a variable. A weakness to be... optimized."*
* **Audio Log #3 (Tristan):** *"The new subject shows remarkable resilience. But all data streams can be broken. All wills can be erased."* (This log is about the player).
