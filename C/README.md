# C Programming Lab

This folder contains my complete C programming learning journey, from fundamentals to applied systems-level projects. I'm building a deep foundation in C to understand memory management, pointer arithmetic, and systems internals. This forms the core of my systems engineering trajectory.

## 📁 Structure

C/
├── basics/ # Syntax, control structures, math ops, scope
├── commands/ # Tiny utilities (e.g. devlog)
├── intermediate/ # More structured projects with Makefiles
├── KnRBook/ # Exercises from The C Programming Language (Kernighan & Ritchie)
├── proximal-development/ # More applied or exploratory mini-projects
└── README.md

## 📌 Highlights

- **basics/**: Includes short C programs demonstrating loops, conditionals, functions, and scope.
- **commands/**: Contains CLI-based C programs and my early command utilities.
- **intermediate/taskManager/**: A functional task queue manager with modular structure and Makefile support.
- **KnRBook/**: Solutions and practice from the canonical K&R book.
- **proximal-development/**:
  - `passwordManager/`: A simple credentials utility with manual input.
  - `textGame/`: A prototype for a text-based adventure engine.
  - `webServer/`: Early socket experimentation.
  - `simpleCalc/`: Arithmetic parser/runner.

## 🛠 Tooling

- Compiled with `gcc` and structured via `Makefile` where needed.
- Linted and debugged with `valgrind`, `gdb`, and `clang-format`.
- Built for experimentation on Linux via CLI.

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- Manual memory management and pointer fluency
- Systems-level I/O and socket programming
- Clean modular C with header/implementation separation
- Deepening project structure (bin/obj/src/Makefile) discipline
